  American Stock Markets","We investigate a factor that can affect the number of links of a specific
stock in a network between stocks created by the minimal spanning tree (MST)
method, by using individual stock data listed on the S&P500 and KOSPI. Among
the common factors mentioned in the arbitrage pricing model (APM), widely
acknowledged in the financial field, a representative market index is
established as a possible factor. We found that the correlation distribution,
$\rho_{ij}$, of 400 stocks taken from the S&P500 index shows a very similar
with that of the Korean stock market and those deviate from the correlation
distribution of time series removed a nonlinearity by the surrogate method. We
also shows that the degree distribution of the MSTs for both stock markets
follows a power-law distribution with the exponent $\zeta \sim$ 2.1, while the
degree distribution of the time series eliminated a nonlinearity follows an
exponential distribution with the exponent, $\delta \sim 0.77$. Furthermore the
correlation, $\rho_{iM}$, between the degree k of individual stock, $i$, and
the market index, $M$, follows a power-law distribution, $<\rho_{iM}(k) > \sim
k^{\gamma}$, with the exponent $\gamma_{\textrm{S&P500}} \approx 0.16$ and
$\gamma_{\textrm{KOSPI}} \approx 0.14$, respectively. Thus, regardless of the
markets, the indivisual stocks closely related to the common factor in the
market, the market index, are likely to be located around the center of the
network between stocks, while those weakly related to the market index are
likely to be placed in the outside.",
Common Market Law Review,http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.6655v1,Learning Performance of Prediction Markets with Kelly Bettors,"In evaluating prediction markets (and other crowd-prediction mechanisms),
investigators have repeatedly observed a so-called ""wisdom of crowds"" effect,
which roughly says that the average of participants performs much better than
the average participant. The market price---an average or at least aggregate of
traders' beliefs---offers a better estimate than most any individual trader's
opinion. In this paper, we ask a stronger question: how does the market price
compare to the best trader's belief, not just the average trader. We measure
the market's worst-case log regret, a notion common in machine learning theory.
To arrive at a meaningful answer, we need to assume something about how traders
behave. We suppose that every trader optimizes according to the Kelly criteria,
a strategy that provably maximizes the compound growth of wealth over an
(infinite) sequence of market interactions. We show several consequences.
First, the market prediction is a wealth-weighted average of the individual
participants' beliefs. Second, the market learns at the optimal rate, the
market price reacts exactly as if updating according to Bayes' Law, and the
market prediction has low worst-case log regret to the best individual
participant. We simulate a sequence of markets where an underlying true
probability exists, showing that the market converges to the true objective
frequency as if updating a Beta distribution, as the theory predicts. If agents
adopt a fractional Kelly criteria, a common practical variant, we show that
agents behave like full-Kelly agents with beliefs weighted between their own
and the market's, and that the market price converges to a time-discounted
frequency. Our analysis provides a new justification for fractional Kelly
betting, a strategy widely used in practice for ad-hoc reasons. Finally, we
propose a method for an agent to learn her own optimal Kelly fraction.",

In Web 2.0, what connected consumers create is not simply content (e.g.

families of criteria: how recommendations are formed and input data
availability. The classification is presented under a common minimal matrix

Specifically, we propose a variant Hotelling model where companies and
customers are represented by points in an Euclidean space, with axes being
product features. $N$ companies compete to maximize their own profits by
optimally choosing their prices, while each customer in the market, when
choosing sellers, considers the sum of product price, discrepancy between
product feature and his preference, and a company's brand name, which is
modeled by a function of its market area of the form $-\beta\cdot\text{(Market
Area)}^q$, where $\beta$ captures the brand influence and $q$ captures how
market share affects the brand. By varying the parameters $\beta$ and $q$, we
derive existence results of Nash equilibrium and equilibrium market prices and
shares. In particular, we prove that pure Nash equilibrium always exists when
$q=0$ for markets with either one and two dominating features, and it always
exists in a single dominating feature market when market affects brand name
linearly, i.e., $q=1$. Moreover, we show that at equilibrium, a company's price
is proportional to its market area over the competition intensity with its
neighbors, a result that quantitatively reconciles the common belief of a
company's pricing power. We also study an interesting ""wipe out"" phenomenon
that only appears when $q>0$, which is similar to the ""undercut"" phenomenon in
the Hotelling model, where companies may suddenly lose the entire market area

importance in processes such as rumors or fads propagation, spread of product

indirect measurements. Here we present an integrated experimental and
theoretical framework to understand and quantitatively predict how and when
information spreads over social networks. Using data collected in Viral
Marketing campaigns that reached over 31,000 individuals in eleven European

the same piece of information. This have a profound effect on information
diffusion: Firstly, most of the transmission takes place due to super-spreading
events which would be considered extraordinary in population-average models.
Secondly, due to the different way individuals schedule information
transmission we observe a slowing down of the spreading of information in
social networks that happens in logarithmic time. Quantitative description of
the experiments is possible through an stochastic branching process which
corroborates the importance of heterogeneity. Since high variability of both
the intensity and frequency of human responses are found in many other

of this paper is to understand and characterize the impact of social influence

  We present complexity-theoretic and algorithmic results for approximating

functions can be computed in polynomial time by convex programming. Our
complexity results show that even a bounded-degree, planar influence network
can significantly increase the difficulty of equilibrium computation even in
markets with only a constant number of goods. Our algorithmic results suggest
that finding an approximate equilibrium in markets with hierarchical influence
networks might be easier than that in markets with arbitrary neighborhood
structures. By demonstrating a simple market with a constant number of goods
and a bounded-degree, planar influence graph whose equilibrium is PPAD-hard to
approximate, we also provide a counterexample to a common belief, which we
refer to as the myth of a constant number of goods, that equilibria in markets

such conversation flows for better conversation response generation.
ConceptFlow grounds the conversation inputs to the latent concept space and
represents the potential conversation flow as a concept flow along the

that models the possibility of the conversation evolving towards different
concepts. The conversation response is then decoded using the encodings of both
utterance texts and concept flows, integrating the learned conversation
structure in the concept space. Our experiments on Reddit conversations
demonstrate the advantage of ConceptFlow over previous commonsense aware dialog

critical gaps in their capacity for natural interactions. One limitation is

interlocutor's conversational style, and a 2nd, expressive, embodied
conversational agent (ECA) that can recognize human behavior during open-ended
conversations and automatically align its responses to the visual and

leverages multimodal inputs to produce rich and perceptually valid vocal and

derailment as an emerging property of a conversation rather than as an isolated
utterance-level event.
  Forecasting emerging conversational properties, however, poses several
inherent modeling challenges. First, since conversations are dynamic, a
forecasting model needs to capture the flow of the discussion, rather than
properties of individual comments. Second, real conversations have an unknown
horizon: they can end or derail at any time; thus a practical forecasting model
needs to assess the risk in an online fashion, as the conversation develops. In
this work we introduce a conversational forecasting model that learns an
unsupervised representation of conversational dynamics and exploits it to

  Search","Recent advances in conversational systems have changed the search paradigm.
Traditionally, a user poses a query to a search engine that returns an answer
based on its index, possibly leveraging external knowledge bases and
conditioning the response on earlier interactions in the search session. In a
natural conversation, there is an additional source of information to take into
account: utterances produced earlier in a conversation can also be referred to
and a conversational IR system has to keep track of information conveyed by the
user during the conversation, even if it is implicit.
  We argue that the process of building a representation of the conversation
can be framed as a machine reading task, where an automated system is presented
with a number of statements about which it should answer questions. The
questions should be answered solely by referring to the statements provided,
without consulting external knowledge. The time is right for the information
retrieval community to embrace this task, both as a stand-alone task and
integrated in a broader conversational search setting.
  In this paper, we focus on machine reading as a stand-alone task and present
the Attentive Memory Network (AMN), an end-to-end trainable machine reading
algorithm. Its key contribution is in efficiency, achieved by having an
hierarchical input encoder, iterating over the input only once. Speed is an
important requirement in the setting of conversational search, as gaps between
conversational turns have a detrimental effect on naturalness. On 20 datasets

as the follower. The leader is provided with a knowledge graph and asked to
sequentially change the discussion topics, following the given conversation
goal, and meanwhile keep the dialogue as natural and engaging as possible.
DuConv enables a very challenging task as the model needs to both understand

setting of conversational search. One of its major challenges is to leverage
the conversation history to understand and answer the current question. In this
work, we propose a novel solution for ConvQA that involves three aspects.
First, we propose a positional history answer embedding method to encode
conversation history with position information using BERT in a natural way.
BERT is a powerful technique for text representation. Second, we design a
history attention mechanism (HAM) to conduct a ""soft selection"" for
conversation histories. This method attends to history turns with different
weights based on how helpful they are on answering the current question. Third,
in addition to handling conversation history, we take advantage of multi-task
learning (MTL) to do answer prediction along with another essential
conversation task (dialog act prediction) using a uniform model architecture.
MTL is able to learn more expressive and generic representations to improve the
performance of ConvQA. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model with
extensive experimental evaluations on QuAC, a large-scale ConvQA dataset. We
show that position information plays an important role in conversation history
modeling. We also visualize the history attention and provide new insights into
conversation history understanding.",

theoretical analysis of the conversion dynamics in these systems, and show that
they are capable of converting single- and multi-photon quantum states.
Analytic formulas for the conversion efficiency, spectral conversion
probability density, and pump power requirements are derived which are in good

only modest improvement to the state of the art, efficiencies exceeding 95% are

construction of dialog systems using a human-to-human dialog corpus. Recently,
Vinyals et al. tested neural conversation models using OpenSubtitles. Lowe et
al. released the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus for researching unstructured multi-turn
dialogue systems. Furthermore, the approach has been extended to accomplish
task oriented dialogs to provide information properly with natural
conversation. For example, Ghazvininejad et al. proposed a knowledge grounded
neural conversation model [3], where the research is aiming at combining
conversational dialogs with task-oriented knowledge using unstructured data
such as Twitter data for conversation and Foursquare data for external
knowledge.However, the task is still limited to a restaurant information
service, and has not yet been tested with a wide variety of dialog tasks. In
addition, it is still unclear how to create intelligent dialog systems that can
respond like a human agent.
  In consideration of these problems, we proposed a challenge track to the 6th
dialog system technology challenges (DSTC6) using human-to-human dialog data to
mimic human dialog behaviors. The focus of the challenge track is to train
end-to-end conversation models from human-to-human conversation and accomplish
end-to-end dialog tasks in various situations assuming a customer service, in
which a system plays a role of human agent and generates natural and
informative sentences in response to user's questions or comments given dialog

Cortana, and Amazon's Echo, have quickly become a part of our digital life.
However, these assistants have major limitations, which prevents users from
conversing with them as they would with human dialog partners. This limits our
ability to observe how users really want to interact with the underlying
system. To address this problem, we developed a crowd-powered conversational
assistant, Chorus, and deployed it to see how users and workers would interact
together when mediated by the system. Chorus sophisticatedly converses with end
users over time by recruiting workers on demand, which in turn decide what
might be the best response for each user sentence. Up to the first month of our
deployment, 59 users have held conversations with Chorus during 320
conversational sessions. In this paper, we present an account of Chorus'
deployment, with a focus on four challenges: (i) identifying when conversations
are over, (ii) malicious users and workers, (iii) on-demand recruiting, and
(iv) settings in which consensus is not enough. Our observations could assist

ability to create themselves through the use of cell division and cell
differentiation. In this work a simple physical model is proposed for
biological cell division. The model consists of a positive ionic gradient
across the cell membrane, and concentration of charge at the nodes of the
spindle and on the chromosomes. A simple calculation, based on Coulomb's Law,
shows that under such circumstances a chromosome will tend to break up to its
constituent chromatids and that the chromatids will be separated by a distance
that is an order of thirty percent of the distance between the spindle nodes.
Further repulsion between the nodes will tend to stretch the cell and
eventually break the cell membrane between the separated chromatids, leading to
cell division. The importance of this work is in continuing the understanding
of the electromagnetic basis of cell division and providing it with an
analytical model. A central implication of this and other studies is to give
theoretical support to the notion that cell division can be manipulated by
electromagnetic means. Requirements on the ingredients of more sophisticated
models for biological cell division will also discussed.

Developers both contribute effort in the form of patches and demand effort from

and characterize patterns of effort contribution and demand throughout the open
source supply chain and investigate if and how these patterns vary with
developer activity; identify different groups of developers; and predict
developers' company affiliation based on their participation patterns. Method:
1,376,946 issues and pull-requests created for 4433 NPM packages with over
10,000 monthly downloads and full (public) commit activity data of the 272,142
issue creators is obtained and analyzed and dependencies on NPM packages are
identified. Fuzzy c-means clustering algorithm is used to find the groups among
the users based on their effort contribution and demand patterns, and Random
Forest is used as the predictive modeling technique to identify their company
affiliations. Result: Users contribute and demand effort primarily from
packages that they depend on directly with only a tiny fraction of
contributions and demand going to transitive dependencies. A significant
portion of demand goes into packages outside the users' respective supply
chains (constructed based on publicly visible version control data). Three and
two different groups of users are observed based on the effort demand and
effort contribution patterns respectively. The Random Forest model used for
identifying the company affiliation of the users gives a AUC-ROC value of 0.68.
Conclusion: Our results give new insights into effort demand and supply at

using data. Those security objectives, for example confidentiality or secrecy,
are often defined in the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language that
promotes interoperability between different systems. In this paper, we show the
necessity of incorporating the requirements of legislation into access control.

control systems our main focus is on law-compliant cross-border data access. By
including legislation directly into access decisions, this lawfulness can be
ensured. We also describe our information model to demonstrate how these

contextual information interrelate. Finally, we outline an event flow for a

by the addition of long-range shortcuts added with probability $P(r_{ij})\sim

improved networks, we performed numerical simulation of multiple discrete
package navigation and found a limit for the amount of packages flowing through

packages $p_{c}$, where above this value a transition to a congested state
occurs. Moreover, $p_{c}$ is found to follow a power-law, $p_{c}\sim
L^{-\gamma}$, where $L$ is the network size. Our results indicate the presence

  environments","Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to present a CAD-based human-robot
interface that allows non-expert users to teach a robot in a manner similar to
that used by human beings to teach each other.
  Design/methodology/approach - Intuitive robot programming is achieved by
using CAD drawings to generate robot programs off-line. Sensory feedback allows
minimization of the effects of uncertainty, providing information to adjust the
robot paths during robot operation.
  Findings - It was found that it is possible to generate a robot program from
a common CAD drawing and run it without any major concerns about calibration or
CAD model accuracy.
  Research limitations/implications - A limitation of the proposed system has
to do with the fact that it was designed to be used for particular
technological applications.
  Practical implications - Since most manufacturing companies have CAD packages
in their facilities today, CAD-based robot programming may be a good option to
program robots without the need for skilled robot programmers.
  Originality/value - The paper proposes a new CAD-based robot programming
system. Robot programs are directly generated from a CAD drawing running on a
commonly available 3D CAD package (Autodesk Inventor) and not from a
commercial, computer aided robotics (CAR) software, making it a simple CAD
integrated solution. This is a low-cost and low-setup time system where no
advanced robot programming skills are required to operate it. In summary, robot
programs are generated with a high-level of abstraction from the robot
language.","Industrial Robot: An International Journal, Vol. 39 Iss: 3, 2012,

continuing controversy over whether differences in stock price behaviour are
due to market structure or company characteristics. As the influence of market
structure on stock prices may be obscured by exogenous factors such as demand
and supply, we hypothesize that modulation of the flow of transactions due to
market operations may carry a stronger imprint of the internal market
mechanism. We analyse times between consecutive transactions (ITT) for NYSE and
NASDAQ stocks, and we relate the dynamical properties of the ITT with those of
the corresponding price fluctuations. We find a robust scale-invariant temporal
organisation in the ITT of stocks which is independent of individual company
characteristics and industry sector, but which depends on market structure. We
find that stocks registered on the NASDAQ exhibit stronger correlations in
their transaction timing within a trading day, compared with NYSE stocks.
Further, we find that companies that transfer from the NASDAQ to the NYSE show
a reduction in the correlation strength of transaction timing within a trading
day, after the move, suggesting influences of market structure. Surprisingly,
we also observe that stronger power-law correlations in the ITT are coupled
with stronger power-law correlations in absolute price returns and higher price
volatility, suggesting a strong link between the dynamical properties of ITT
and the corresponding price fluctuations over a broad range of time scales.
Comparing the NYSE and NASDAQ, we demonstrate that the higher correlations we
find in ITT for NASDAQ stocks are matched by higher correlations in absolute
price returns and by higher volatility, suggesting that market structure may
affect price behaviour through information contained in transaction timing.",

that have larger numbers of patents per applicant generally exhibiting smaller
exponents in both the simulated and actual data. Similarly we find that the
exponents for most countries are inversely correlated with other indicators of

suggests that in more advanced economies, which tend to have smaller values of
the exponent, a greater proportion of the total number of patents are filed by

two million firms for two decades (1994-2015), we compile the dataset of

number of trading partners. We find that the number of employees is more
influential in determining firm sales compared to the number of trading
partners. This asymmetry is validated by regressions of sales against these
parameters and the analysis of growth rate correlations. We then explore
multi-variate dynamics of firms by elaborating an evolutionary flow diagram of
the averaged motion in the three-dimensional vector space. The flow diagram
indicates that firms which deviate from the balanced scaling relation tend to
return to this relation. We also find that firms with a chance of large sales

particular sequence of work and days-off blocks among those that have optimal
weekend characteristics, (3) enumerating possible shift sequences for the
chosen work blocks subject to shift change constraints and bounds on sequences

developers. In this paper, we investigate the use of sketches and diagrams in
software engineering practice. To this end, we used both quantitative and
qualitative methods. We present the results of an exploratory study in three
companies and an online survey with 394 participants. Our participants included
software developers, software architects, project managers, consultants, as
well as researchers. They worked in different countries and on projects from a
wide range of application areas. Most questions in the survey were related to
the last sketch or diagram that the participants had created. Contrary to our
expectations and previous work, the majority of sketches and diagrams contained
at least some UML elements. However, most of them were informal. The most
common purposes for creating sketches and diagrams were designing, explaining,
and understanding, but analyzing requirements was also named often. More than
half of the sketches and diagrams were created on analog media like paper or
whiteboards and have been revised after creation. Most of them were used for
more than a week and were archived. We found that the majority of participants
related their sketches to methods, classes, or packages, but not to source code
artifacts with a lower level of abstraction.",

  Swarms","Nowadays, companies such as Amazon, Alibaba, and even pizza chains are
pushing forward to use drones, also called UAVs (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles), for
service provision, such as package and food delivery. As governments intend to
use these immense economic benefits that UAVs have to offer, urban planners are
moving forward to incorporate so-called UAV flight zones and UAV highways in
their smart city designs. However, the high-speed mobility and behavior
dynamics of UAVs need to be monitored to detect and, subsequently, to deal with
intruders, rogue drones, and UAVs with a malicious intent. This paper proposes
a UAV defense system for the purpose of intercepting and escorting a malicious
UAV outside the flight zone. The proposed UAV defense system consists of a
defense UAV swarm, which is capable to self-organize its defense formation in
the event of intruder detection, and chase the malicious UAV as a networked
swarm. Modular design principles have been used for our fully localized
approach. We developed an innovative auto-balanced clustering process to
realize the intercept- and capture-formation. As it turned out, the resulting
networked defense UAV swarm is resilient against communication losses. Finally,
a prototype UAV simulator has been implemented. Through extensive simulations,
we show the feasibility and performance of our approach.",
company law package,http://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09155v2,CityJSON: A compact and easy-to-use encoding of the CityGML data model,"The international standard CityGML is both a data model and an exchange
format to store digital 3D models of cities. While the data model is used by
several cities, companies, and governments, in this paper we argue that its
XML-based exchange format has several drawbacks. These drawbacks mean that it
is difficult for developers to implement parsers for CityGML, and that
practitioners have, as a consequence, to convert their data to other formats if
they want to exchange them with others. We present CityJSON, a new JSON-based
exchange format for the CityGML data model (version 2.0.0). CityJSON was
designed with programmers in mind, so that software and APIs supporting it can
be quickly built. It was also designed to be compact (a compression factor of
around six with real-world datasets), and to be friendly for web and mobile
development. We argue that it is considerably easier to use than the CityGML
format, both for reading and for creating datasets. We discuss in this paper
the main features of CityJSON, briefly present the different software packages
to parse/view/edit/create files (including one to automatically convert between
the JSON and GML encodings), analyse how real-world datasets compare to those
of CityGML, and we also introduce \emph{Extensions}, which allow us to extend
the core data model in a documented manner.",

  the reality of companies","Studying design creativity and innovation from practical perspectives for
companies requires both a good understanding of the company ecosystem and its
inner processes contributing to delivered innovations and a rigorous design
research methodology to provide effective design models, methods, platforms
that are truly effective in the context of company. Working in an Industrial
Engineering laboratory, we advocate a more systemic vision of design creativity
and innovation in company ecosystems. We present in this paper an attempt to
develop and make professional an innovation engineering. Our research works are
illustrated along the different research topics of an innovation process. We
start by a recent survey on innovation practice and organizational models led
in 28 large companies. The lessons learned about this survey reinforce our
belief that there is a need for a new method in agile management of radical
innovation projects in company contexts. We currently develop, test and apply
such a methodology named: Radical Innovation Design(RID). Its effectiveness has
been evaluated through a large scale evaluation of the project outcomes for the
company. Two extensions of RID have been proposed and deployed in company
contexts: a selection procedure for innovation clusters and a value-driven
process for airplane development projects.","International Journal of Design Creativity and Innovation 2 (2013)
